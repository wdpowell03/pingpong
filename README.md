This was a project that I did in my Udemy course, "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2025".



I used HTML, CSS (Bulma), and JS to make this interactive game. The initial code along only
implemented a score keeping feature, but I wanted to expand on that and make a simple, fun way to 
pass time. 

Click "Hit The Ball", then take your choice of (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) to try and score
on the computer.
