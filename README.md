This was a project that I did in my udemy course, "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2025"
I used HTML, CSS (Bulma), and JS to make this interactive game.
I plan on implementing some feature in the future where the ping pong hits are based on some logic puzzle (a mini game within the game) against a computer.
Whether you win or lose against the computer in the minigame, you will "hit" the ball, gaining a point.
